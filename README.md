# wonderful-i8086

Experimental C toolchain for the WonderSwan. Early development.

## Known limitations

* Read-only data (const arrays, etc.) will only end up in ROM if declared as `__far`.
    * To be more precise, by default, pointers are near pointers. In wonderful-i8086, this means they can only point to the console RAM. To point to SRAM or the console ROM, far pointers must be utilized.

## Rough build instructions

Only Linux is officially supported at this time. Using WSL2 on Windows is recommended. The scripts have been tested on Arch Linux.

    # create directory
    $ mkdir -p /opt/wonderful/i8086
    # build tools
    $ cd toolchain
    $ ./fetch.sh
    $ ./build.sh all
    # build base support
    $ cd ../support
    $ make install
    # build libc
    $ cd ../libc
    $ make install
    # build liblzsa
    $ cd ../liblzsa
    $ make install
    # build libws
    $ cd ../libws
    $ make install
