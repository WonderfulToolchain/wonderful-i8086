# liblzsa

Library for decompressing binary data packed with [LZSA1 and/or LZSA2](https:  github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa/).

There are two variants provided:

 * `-llzsa`: default, optimized for speed,
 * `-llzsa_small`: alternate, optimized for size (~130-200 bytes smaller per algorithm).

## License

Both variants are licensed under the terms of the zlib license, however the notices differ:
